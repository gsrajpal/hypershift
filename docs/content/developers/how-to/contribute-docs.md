# How to contribute docs

Documentation is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io).

1. Start a local site preview server:

        make serve-containerized

1. Visit the site at [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000).

1. Add files to the `docs` directory and see your changes immediately reflected.
